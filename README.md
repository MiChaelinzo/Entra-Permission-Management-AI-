# Entra-Permission-Management-AI-
The project above is a browser extension that uses machine learning to train a model with a user's browsing history data and use it to make a decision on granting or blocking permissions for websites. The idea behind the project is that by analyzing a user's browsing history and habits, the extension can automatically adjust the permissions for each website to better suit the user's needs. The extension could analyze a user's browsing history and habits, such as the websites they visit, the permissions they grant, and the time they spend on each website, and use this information to make decisions.

It is important to note that this project raises some security, privacy and ethical concerns, as it would require collecting and storing a large amount of data on the user's browsing history and habits, which could be sensitive information. Additionally, it could lead to ethical concerns, as it can have negative impact on certain groups of people or websites.
